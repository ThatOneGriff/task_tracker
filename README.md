# Task Tracker CLI

This project got me to make a simple task tracking tool. I give credit for the idea to roadmap.sh.
One of the rules said not to use any external dependencies, but I decided to break it for the self-ed sake.

## Why this project matters

- It made me learn basic CMake;
- It taught me to use external dependencies in C++ projects;
- It gave me practice in debug and problem-solving.

The build instructions may come later. It's not a project I planned for someone to build, because it breaks the rule I mentioned before, and thus cannot compete among similar projects on roadmap.sh.
